					<h2 class="wd-services">Company Branding And Identity Design</h2>
					<p class="lead">The first thing your customers will experience is your brand and logo.</p>
					<h5>A New Brand</h5>
					<p>
						One of the biggest mistakes new business owners make is ignoring their brand or identity altogether. Instead, their marketing material becomes of a hodgepodge of different ideas, which results in an identity crises for the business, and a lack of professional appearance.

						Your brand will be the foundation that all of your marketing material will be built upon. This includes stationary like your business cards, your website, and the sign posted outside of your office.

						We provide a branding and identity package which provides this foundation for your company. <br>
					</p>
					<h5>Existing Brands</h5>
					<p>
						Eventually there comes a time to revisit your current brand and make an update. This isn’t a complete overhaul, instead, you can think of it as a fresh coat of paint. </p>

						<h5>Working With You</h5>
						<p>
							We will work directly with your company to discover your unique abilities and traits and create a brand that best projects your business to the world.</p>

							<h2 class="wd-services">Landing Page Design &amp; Development</h2>
							<p class="lead">A landing page is a web page where visitors will land when they click on your  advertisement, or on a link from your marketing email. They are an integral piece in marketing plans.</p>
							<h5>An Example</h5>
							<p>
								For example, say that your business sells both dog and cat food. You have created an Adwords campaign on Google that advertises the amazing cat food formula that your company has just started producing. Instead of linking to your homepage and hoping that the visitor is smart enough to find this cat food formula, you would direct them to a landing page that focuses only on the great benefits of this new formula. <br>

								The primary focus is having the visitor go out and purchase this great new cat food or sign them up for a marketing campaign in the future. <br>

								In a nutshell, a landing page is custom tailored to increase sales or leads for your business. </p>

								<h5>Working Directly With Your Company</h5>
								<p>
									We work directly with your company to discover your needs and your marketing campaign.

									We’ll brainstorm on ideas to create a successful converting landing page and work with you each step of the way.</p>
